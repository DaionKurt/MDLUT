# Decision Tree Learning for PHP (ID3 Algorithm)

> Decision tree learning is one of the most widely used and practical methods for inductive inference. It is a method for approximating discrete-valued functions that is robust to noisy data and capable of learning disjunctive expression. -- Machine Learning by Tom M.Mitchell

This library is intended for experimental usage. I'm newbie in machine learning. I tried to incorporate my undertanding on decision tree learning algorithm into php, but it's experimental. Code is unproductive and error prone.
